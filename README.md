## conventional commits

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention for commit messages, providing a simple set of rules for creating explicit commit histories. It standardises commit messages to improve readability and facilitate automated tooling. The format includes a type, such as `feat` for new features or `fix` for bug fixes, and a brief description. This convention dovetails with Semantic Versioning (SemVer) by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes in commit messages, aiding in the automation of versioning and release notes generation.
